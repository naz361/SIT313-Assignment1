<!--The method for each dish-->
<p>METHODS</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b></p><p>Place the flour in a large bowl and season well with salt and pepper. Add the beef and gently toss to lightly coat with the flour mixture. Heat half the oil in a large flameproof casserole dish over high heat. Add one-quarter of the beef and cook, turning occasionally, for 5 minutes or until brown all over. Transfer to a heatproof bowl. Continue in 3 more batches.</p>

<p><b>Step 2</b></p><p>Heat the remaining oil in the pan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes or until onion is lightly golden. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute or until aromatic. Add the beef, Guinness, beef stock, bay leaves and thyme and bring to the boil. Reduce heat to very low and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, for 1 1/2-2 hours or until beef is tender and sauce thickens slightly. Remove from heat and season with salt and pepper. Set aside for 30 minutes to cool slightly.</p>

<p><b>Step 3</b></p><p>Preheat oven to 200Â°C. Spoon beef mixture evenly among four 1 1/2-cup (375ml) ovenproof dishes. Cut the pastry into quarters and lightly brush with egg. Place a piece of pastry over each dish and use a small, sharp knife to cut a small slit in the top of each pie to help release steam. Place on an oven tray and bake for 15 minutes or until pastry is puffed and golden. Remove from oven and serve immediately with mashed potatoes and peas or beans.</p>
